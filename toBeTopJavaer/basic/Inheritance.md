# Inheritance

## Definition

Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other. OOP allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. In Java, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.

## Examples

```java
class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
    //fields
}

```
